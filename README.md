A Data Narrative assignment created by Michael Woodward

This Website was created to test my abilities with coding an html website and applying JavaScript databases.
This website is able to desplay data, add data, edit existing data, and delete data. All of which is able to be saved.
It is a navigable html site that desplays the data or info differently depending on the page.
